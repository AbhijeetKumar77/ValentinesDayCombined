The second reason is, maybe we should know more about each other, but fir bhi Will you be my valentine? &#10; If you want to take some time or days, please take your time. If you want to get to know me more, that is also perfectly fine. &#10;&#10; Okay Byee ðŸ˜Š and Happy Valentine's Day meri Cutie Pie ðŸ’–</textarea>
